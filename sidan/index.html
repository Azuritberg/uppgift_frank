                    </ul>
                    <p>Channel Orange (stylized as channel ORANGE) is the debut studio album by American R&B
                        singer-songwriter Frank Ocean. It was released on July 10, 2012, by Def Jam Recordings. After
                        releasing his mixtape Nostalgia, Ultra the previous year, Ocean began writing new songs with
                        Malay, a producer and songwriter who then assisted him with recording Channel Orange at EastWest
                        Studios in Hollywood. Rather than rely on samples as he had with his mixtape, Ocean wanted to
                        approach sound and song structure differently on the album. Other producers who worked on the
                        album included Om'Mas Keith and Pharrell Williams.</p>

                    <h3><i>Released July,</i> 2016</h3>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Frank Ocean, Producer & Artist</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Blonde (alternatively titled blond) is the second studio album by Frank Ocean. In 2013, Ocean
                        confirmed that his follow up to Channel Orange would be another concept album. Initially known
                        as Boys Don't Cry and teased for a July 2015 release, the album suffered several delays and was
                        the subject of widespread media anticipation leading up to its release. Blonde features an
                        abstract and experimental sound in comparison to Ocean's previous releases, encompassing styles
                        such as R&B, pop, soul, avant-garde, indie rock, electronica, psychedelia, and hip hop. Ocean
                        also notably makes use of pitch shifted vocals.</p>
